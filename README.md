This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## To Install Angular
Make sure you have downloaded node first, I'm on windows so I downloaded and installed node for windows, once installed, open node.js command prompt (You Can search for it via the windows start bar)
Then in the node command prompt type in the command below:
